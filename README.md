PROHBITOR - BOOTLEGGER - AMBITION - 'BITION
** Oregon Trail meets DopeWars **

Distance Between Nodes


Eccentric Logic:
The longer you do not day labor, you more you attract attention from the police!
The larger any booze supply gets, the more attention you can attract
the further distance you transport your booze, the more heat you can get.
Larger populated areas have more competition, so prices are lower.
sparsely populated / further distances can pull higher prices
Having too much of any 1 resource attracts attention
Prices start out higher at the beginning, then gradually come down over the course of 'bition
