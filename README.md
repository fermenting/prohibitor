This game is a work in progress, and could use your help! Here's what's on the docket so far:

PROHBITOR
** Oregon Trail meets DopeWars **

It's prohibition. Every month, you're able to make booze, sell booze, and ship booze. Every decision carries some risk, and the absolitionists are hot on your tail, ready to bust your casks and your skull if they can catch you - but you won't let 'em. Time to get while the getting is good.

You start with nothing. Will you be able to make something?!
